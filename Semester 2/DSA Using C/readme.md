# Data Structure
In Computer Science, the different models used to organize data in the main memory are collectively referred to as Data Structure.

## Classification of Data Structure

### Linear Data Structure
A Data Structure whose elements form a sequence and every element in the structure has a unique predecessor and a unique successor is called a linear data structure.
Example: Arrays, Stack, Queue, Linked Lists.

### Non-Linear Data Structure
A data structure whose elements do not form any sequence and do not have a positional order is called a non-linear data structure. They may not have a unique predecessor or successor.
Example: Trees, Graphs.

### Time Complexity
Time complexity refers to the time required to execute an algirithm. There are three scenarios for a given algorithm, Best Case, Average Case, and the Worst case. <br> Since Best Case in almost every algorithm is O(1). The average and the worst case is taken into account.
### Space Complexity 
Problem-solving using computer requires memory to hold temporary data or final result while the program is in execution. The amount of memory required by the algorithm to solve given problem is called space complexity of the algorithm.
