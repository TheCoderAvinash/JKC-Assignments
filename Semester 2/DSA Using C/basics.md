### Linear Data Structure
A Data Structure whose elements form sequence and every element in the structure has a unique predecessor and a unique successor is called a linear data structure.
Example: Arrays, Stack, Queue, Linked Lists.

### Non-Linear Data Structure
A data structure whose elements do not form any sequence and do not have a positional order are called non-linear data structure. They may not have unique predecessor or successor.
Example: Trees, Graphs.
